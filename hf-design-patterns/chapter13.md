#### Better Living with Patterns: Patterns in the Real World

## Appendix

### Design Pattern
    A Pattern is a solution to a problem in a context.
    - The context is the situation in which the pattern applies. This should be a recurring situation.
    - The problem refers to the goal you are trying to achieve in this context, but it also refers to any constraints that occur in the context.
    - The solution is what youâ€™re after: a general design that anyone can apply which resolves the goal and set of constraints.
